	<h1>Projects</h1>

	<p>Here's a running a list of a few of the non-work projects I've put together over the last few years. All are still ongoing, unless there's a date listed.</p>

	<div class ="project">
	<h2>Ewing &amp; Ewing Toys</h2>
	<p>One of my favorite things about being a father is that it's inspired me to start making toys. My own father is signficantly handier than I am, so this has morphed into a project for 3 generations of Ewings. Here are a few of our recent creations.</p>

	<h2>FRED talks</h2>
	<p>FRED talks are short TED style talks by your friends (or your friends-friends). I've been putting them together in San Francisco for a little while now, along with my wife <a href="https://twitter.com/nataliefoster">Natalie</a>, and our friends <a href="https://twitter.com/brattray">Ben Rattray</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cbracy">Cathrine Bracy</a>. We try to organize them every two months, and group them around a single topic. Topics have ranged from the future of cities to love (a Valentine's Day special) to the meaning of money.</p>

	<h2>This Site</h2>
	<p>I designed and built this site from scratch as part of an effort to increase my basic frontend web skills. It's fully responsive and held together by hand-coded HTML and CSS, with a little bit of javascript and jQuery thrown in for good measure. It's hosted on GitHub, and remains a work in progress.</p> 

	<p>The blog is a Jekyl template that I borrowed almost entirely from Barry Clark's <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now"> Jekyll Now</a> project--which is a great resource if you're looking to put together a simple blog.</p>

	<p>Icon's are courtesy of <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a> by Dave Gandy--which is indeed awesome.</p>

	<h2>Inequality Hackathon (2011)</h2>
	<p>Back when Occupy was the big thing, I organized a quick hackathon in SF. We had 60+ people show up and some great projects came out of it. One of them, Occupy Design, ended up becoming an actual organization and did some great work. You can read the details (and enjoy a photo of me very much needing a haircut) here: <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/10/17/hackathon-occupy-wall-street/">Venture Beat: Hackers join worldwide protest.</a></p>
