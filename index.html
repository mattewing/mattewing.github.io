	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I've spent the last 20 years trying to make the world a better place, primarily by using technology to bring people together.</p> 

	<p>Along the way, I've played a lot of roles: managing large teams, leading software and product development, heading up marketing, driving fundraising, and designing cutting edge distributed organizing models &#8212 to name a few </p>

	<p>But, in the end, the thing I love the most is working with a group of talented people to build something that actually matters.</p>

<h1>Recent Projects</h1>

	<p>Here's a running a list of a few of the non-work projects I've put together over the last few years. All are still ongoing, unless there's a date listed.</p>

	<div class ="project">
	<h2>Ewing &amp; Ewing Toys</h2>
	<p>One of my favorite things about being a father is that it's inspired me to start making toys. My own father is signficantly handier than I am, so this has morphed into a project for 3 generations of Ewings. Here are a few of our recent creations.</p>

	<div class="project">
	<h2>FRED talks</h2>
	<p>FRED talks are short TED style talks by your friends (or your friends-friends). I put them together in San Francisco for a few years, along with my wife and our friends. We tried to organize them every two months, and group them around a single topic. Topics ranged from the future of cities to love (a Valentine's Day special) to the meaning of money.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="project">
	<h2>This Site</h2>
	<p>I designed and built this site from scratch as part of an effort to increase my basic frontend web skills. It's fully responsive and held together by hand-coded HTML and CSS, with a little bit of javascript thrown in for good measure. It's hosted on GitHub, powered by Jekyll and remains a work in progress.</p> 

	<p>Icon's are courtesy of <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a> by Dave Gandy--which is indeed awesome.</p>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/mattewing/mattewing.github.io">My clunky code is all open source and yours for the taking.</a></p>
