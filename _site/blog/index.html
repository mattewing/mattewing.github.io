        <p>My biggest side project over the last few months has been building this web site. Here’s a quick overview of what I did, and some thoughts on the process.</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>If you had asked me a few months ago if I knew how to use HTML and CSS, I would have said “Defininately.” But, it turns out that what I actually meant was “Umm.

        <p>Silicon Valley’s top startup program, Y Combinator, graduated its first class of non-profit startups yesterday.</p> <p>As the genre defining startup accelerator, this is a pretty big deal. YC is the same institution that brought us household names like Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit and many more.</p> <p>Traditionally they’ve been very focused on finding the next billion dollar company—and they’ve been quite good at that. So, what will it look like when they start working with non-profits? Well, now we have a few...

        <p>10 years ago, the world lost an incredible human being, and I lost one of my best friends. </p> <p>It was our senior year and we were on spring break in a tiny beach town in southern Costa Rica. The rain had stopped falling, so we decided it was the perfect time to finally jump in the ocean. Unfortunately, no one told us about the vicious riptide.
