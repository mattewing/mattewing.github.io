	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I've spent the last 10 years using technology to bring people together in various attempts to make the world a better place.</p> 

	<p>That's meant everything from helping to elect a President to founding a venture-backed startup.</p>

	<p>Along the way, I've had a plenty of roles: leading large teams, managing software development, heading up marketing, fundraising, creating analytics products and directing campaigns to name a few.</p>

	<p>But, in the end, the thing I always love the most is working with a group of talented people to build something that matters.</p>

	<p>A few of the highlights (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattewing">head over to LinkedIn for the full resume</a>):</p>
	<ul>
	<li>At <a href="http://moveon.org">MoveOn</a>, I developed a new approach to building a field network: peer-to-peer organizing, backed up by modern web tools. With a small team, we were able to  build a national, volunteer-driven network that was capable of matching the rapid pace of online campaigns.</li>
	
	<li>I also helped to design and run MoveOn's 2006 and 2008 electoral campaigns. Through these campaigns we played a huge role in taking back the House and the Senate, and electing President Obama.</li>

	<li>As the Founding Director at <a href="http://newmediaventures.org">New Media Ventures</a>, I launched the country's first network of progressive angel investors and helped to mainstream the idea that you can work to create political change, and have a for-profit business model.</li> 

	<li>Most recently, I headed up marketing and operations as co-founder of <a href="http://scootnetworks.com">Scoot Networks</a>, the world's first network of shared electric scooters. I helped the organization grow from the germ of an idea to a fully operational network with electric scooters parked all around San Francisco and thousands of happy customers. I'm incredibly proud of the work our team continues to.</li>

	<li>I've also had the privilege  to serve as an early advisor to some amazing do-gooder startups like <a href="http://upworthy.com">Upworthy</a> and <a href="https://ethicalelectric.com/">Ethical Electric</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I live in San Francisco with the lovely Natalie Foster (<a href="http://twitter.com/nataliefoster">@nataliefoster</a>) and our baby boy.

	<h1>About This Site</h1>
	<p>I build this site from scratch as part of an effort to increase my basic web skills. It's fully repsonsive and made with hand coded HTML and CSS, with a little bit of javascript and jQuery thrown in for good measure. It's hosted on GitHub, along with <a href="https://github.com/mattewing/simple-personal-page">an easy-to-use template for creating personal sites like this one.</a></p> 

	<p>The blog is a Jekyl template that I borrowed almost entirely from <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Barry Clark's Jekyll Now project</a>--which is an awesome resource if you're looking to put together a simple Jekyl blog.</p>

	<p>Most icons are from the <a href="http://www.thenounproject.com">Noun Project</a>. Thanks to<a href="http://www.thenounproject.com/dracoplayr"> Ash N for the wrench</a> and<a href="http://www.thenounproject.com/tuktuk"> TukTuk Design for the profile icon.</a>
